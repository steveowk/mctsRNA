# RNA Inverse Folding Using Monte Carlo Tree Search


This repository contains code for designing the RNA Sequences in using MCTS.  Here is a brief overview of RNA sequence Design from the abstract of one the papers we had written recently.

<em>
Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) plays a critical role in biological processes such as protein synthesis and gene expression. The design of RNA sequences which folds to match a given target structure is often referred to as RNA Inverse Folding. The RNA Inverse Folding is key to both in vitro and in vivo research. It also has the potential to positively impact disciplines such as synthetic biology, design of functional RNA molecules, biotechnology, drug design and medicine in general.

To run the code, install the [ViennaRNA Package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/doc/html/install.html) which is used to check if your designed sequence matches the given target and python3.7. Other utilities from the sklearn library have also been utilised thus you can do pip install for the  package.

The model can be improved by modelling the value function using DNN-this is a very promising research direction!
